    "# Connect Four\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Connect Four is to get a streak of four of your pieces in any direction — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can place a piece by picking a column. The piece will fall to the lowest available row in that column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Games like Connect Four have much larger trees than a simple Tic Tac Toe, so traversing to the leaves of such a big tree simply takes too much computational power. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two techniques to solve this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first technique puts a hard limit on how far down the tree you allow the algorithm to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second technique uses a clever trick called pruning to avoid exploring parts of the tree that we know will be useless."

    "## Alpha-Beta Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to traverse farther down the tree without dramatically increasing the runtime, we can implement a technique called alpha-beta pruning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to ignore parts of the tree that we know will be dead ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha-beta pruning is accomplished by keeping track of two variables for each node — `alpha` and `beta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`alpha` keeps track of the minimum score the maximizing player can possibly get. It starts at negative infinity and gets updated as that minimum score increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `beta` represents the maximum score the minimizing player can possibly get. It starts at positive infinity and will decrease as that maximum possible score decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any node, if `alpha` is greater than or equal to `beta`, that means that we can stop looking through that node's children. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we'll have to include two new parameters in our function — `alpha` and `beta`. When we first call `minimax()` we'll set `alpha` to negative infinity and `beta` to positive infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to make sure we pass `alpha` and `beta` into our recursive calls. We're passing these two values down the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to check to see if we should reset `alpha` and `beta`. In the maximizing case, we want to reset `alpha` if the newly found `best_value` is greater than `alpha`. In the minimizing case, we want to reset `beta` if `best_value` is less than `beta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after resetting `alpha` and `beta`, we want to check to see if we can prune. If `alpha` is greater than or equal to `beta`, we can `break` and stop looking through the other potential moves. "

    "* We wrote an evaluation function specific to our understanding of the game Connect Four. This evaluation function allows us to stop the recursion before reaching the leaves of the game tree.\n",
    "* We implemented alpha-beta pruning. By cleverly detecting useless sections of the game tree, we’re able to ignore those sections and therefore look farther down the tree."
