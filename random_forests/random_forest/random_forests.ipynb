    "# Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "A _random forest_ is an ensemble machine learning technique — a random forest contains many decision trees that all work together to classify new points. When a random forest is asked to classify a new point, the random forest gives that point to each of the decision trees. Each of those trees reports their classification and the random forest returns the most popular classification. It’s like every tree gets a vote, and the most popular classification wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the trees in the random forest may be overfit, but by making the prediction based on a large number of trees, overfitting will have less of an impact."

    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests create different trees using a process known as __bagging__. Every time a decision tree is made, it is created using a different subset of the points in the training set. For example, if our training set had `1000` rows in it, we could make a decision tree by picking `100` of those rows at random to build the tree. This way, every tree is different, but all trees will still be created from a portion of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that when we’re randomly selecting these `100` rows, we’re doing so with replacement. Picture putting all 100 rows in a bag and reaching in and grabbing one row at random. After writing down what row we picked, we put that row back in our bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we’re picking our `100` random rows, we could pick the same row more than once. In fact, it’s very unlikely, but all `100` randomly picked rows could all be the same row!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we’re picking these rows with replacement, there’s no need to shrink our bagged training set from `1000` rows to `100`. We can pick `1000` rows at random, and because we can get the same row more than once, we’ll still end up with a unique data set."

    "\n",
    "We’re now making trees based on different random subsets of our initial dataset. But we can continue to add variety to the ways our trees are created by changing the features that we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for our car data set, the original features were the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The price of the car\n",
    "* The cost of maintenance\n",
    "* The number of doors\n",
    "* The number of people the car can hold\n",
    "* The size of the trunk\n",
    "* The safety rating\n",

    "Right now when we create a decision tree, we look at every one of those features and choose to split the data based on the feature that produces the most information gain. We could change how the tree is created by only allowing a subset of those features to be considered at each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when finding which feature to split the data on the first time, we might randomly choose to only consider the price of the car, the number of doors, and the safety rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the data on the best feature from that subset, we’ll likely want to split again. For this next split, we’ll randomly select three features again to consider. This time those features might be the cost of maintenance, the number of doors, and the size of the trunk. We’ll continue this process until the tree is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "One question to consider is how to choose the number of features to randomly select. Why did we choose `3` in this example? A good rule of thumb is to randomly select the square root of the total number of features. Our car dataset doesn’t have a lot of features, so in this example, it’s difficult to follow this rule. But if we had a dataset with `25` features, we’d want to randomly select `5` features to consider at every split point."

    "* A _random forest_ is an ensemble machine learning model. It makes a classification by aggregating the classifications of many decision trees.\n",
    "* Random forests are used to avoid overfitting. By aggregating the classification of multiple trees, having overfitted trees in a random forest is less impactful.\n",
    "* Every decision tree in a random forest is created by using a different subset of data points from the training set. Those data points are chosen at random with replacement, which means a single data point can be chosen more than once. This process is known as _bagging_.\n",
